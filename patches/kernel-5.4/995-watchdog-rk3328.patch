The watchdog compatible strings are suppose to be SoC orientated.
In the more recently added Rockchip rk3328.dtsi file only
the fallback string "snps,dw-wdt" is used, so add the new
compatible string:

"rockchip,rk3328-wdt", "snps,dw-wdt"

make ARCH=arm64 dtbs_check
DT_SCHEMA_FILES=Documentation/devicetree/bindings/watchdog/snps,dw-wdt.yaml
